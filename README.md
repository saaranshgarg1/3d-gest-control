# 3D Gesture Control Interface

## Project Overview
A real-time gesture-based interface allowing users to manipulate 3D objects using hand movements captured through a webcam. Built with React, Three.js, and MediaPipe's hand tracking technology.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Gesture Recognition**: Control 3D object rotation by moving your hand in space
- **Pinch-to-Zoom Functionality**: Dynamically resize the 3D model using pinch gestures
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency hand tracking and rendering for responsive interaction
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining performance

## Technologies
- React.js for UI architecture
- Three.js for 3D rendering and manipulation
- MediaPipe Hands for advanced hand tracking
- Vite for optimized development and production builds
